# m¬≤ Bots
m¬≤ is the incentive layer for matsFi. Inspired by Fluidity, the Blockchain Incentive Layer, m¬≤ rewards users for every transaction performed with mats, and incentivizes users for using their mats within the matsFi economy, instead of hoarding them within their wallet.
Fluidity‚Äôs slogan - ‚ÄúMoney designed to be moved.‚Äù

For every transaction performed with mats, users are entered into a no loss lottery, where most of the time, you‚Äôll earn a small cashback (maybe a 100 mats tip earns you 0.1 mats), or if you‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll hit the jackpot and earn the lion‚Äôs share of the epoch‚Äôs remaining prize pool. (each epoch would last 24 hours and have a set prize pool, e.g. 1000 mats)

This is designed for every transaction on matsFi (works by listening to the transaction channel) and stimulates people to tip, play games (such as matsCraft) or in other words GET BUSY transacting on matsFi, as they stand a chance to win big with every transaction. And if not, some pretty sweet cashback.


# How It Works?
### m¬≤ bots will listen every transaction on `üí∏‚îÜtransactions` channel then will capture it as rewards.

## How Rewards Works?     

**TIP REWARDS**   
For Now 1 Mats Calculate As Rewards Is 0.001   

lets say you give tip 1000 mats         
so total yield is 0.001 * 1000 = 1


**Finalize TIP Rewards**  
Sender : 80% From Total Yield  
Receiver : 20% From Total Yield

**CASINO BETS REWARDS**  
Every User Bet On Casino It'll Be Added On Yield Pool Balance
If User Lose On The Game, User Will Get 20% Of Total His Bet As Yield
